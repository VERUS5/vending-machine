# Vending Machine Project

This is a **Java-based Vending Machine** project developed as part of our coursework.  
The system simulates a vending machine where users can interact, operators can manage items, and suppliers can restock products.

## 📌 Project Description
- The program allows **users** to purchase products from the vending machine.
